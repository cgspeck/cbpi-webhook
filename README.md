# cbpi-webhook

Transmit CraftBeer Pi 3 events to a configurable Webhook.

Setup:

1. Manually copy this folder into plugins on your CBPI3 installation
2. Input your Webhook Endpoint into the CBPI3 parameters page (may require a system reboot if parameters not visible).
3. Events should now be pushed to your web hook.

Given that the project has stagnated and has licensing issues, this is likely the final plugin that I will create for this project.
